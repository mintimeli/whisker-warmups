# whisker-warmups

Version 1.0 (Java)
This was created to help artists do warmup drawings without having to spend extra time coming up with something to draw.
This is a console app which allows users to select the furry friend they wish to draw: cat, dog, or either. Selecting "either" will randomly return either a cat or dog.
The program will then return the user a drawing prompt with their selected animal (Ex: "Cat dressed up as a videogame character", "Dog dressed up as a sushi chef").
The program will also prompt the user on whether they'd like another prompt or to end the program, allowing users the option to get multiple prompts while the program is running.
